ASSIGNMENT 2 -- CLASSES
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
1. Create a class called 'Animal'. It should have the following member variables:
   name  (ex. Cow)
   color (ex. Brown)
   sound (ex. Moo)
   type  (ex. Mammal)

2. Make a LIST of this Animal type. This list should be iterable and callable. In other words, if you return
   animalList[2], it should neatly output those member variables in some fashion. Likewise, you need a way
   to sort this class (which I will leave up to you). Attempting to call sort(animalList) should return a list
   of Animal objects organized by X member variable.
